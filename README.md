# CLIVAR bootcamp 2022 Project Template

[This template](https://github.com/clivar-bootcamp2022/clivar-bootcamp2022-template) provides a starting point for [CLIVER bootcamp](https://www.clivar.org/events/arctic-processes-cmip6-bootcamp) work groups.

### What's included?

1. `notebooks`: a place for storing Jupyter Notebooks.  
1. `README.md`: this document - consider modifying to make it a description of your project on GitHub.
1. `LICENSE`: a default (MIT) license file for your project. You can change this if you feel the need.

### How to use this Template

Project leads should follow the next four steps. This only needs to be done once.

1. Navigate to https://github.com/clivar-bootcamp2022/clivar-bootcamp2022-template
2. Click the "Use this template" button
3. Name your work group's project 
4. Provide a brief description
5. Tell your teammates where to find your repository and tell them to "Fork" the project.

Once the initial setup is done, everyone will want to clone the repository onto the compute system they plan to use for the hackathon.

1. Open a JupyterLab session on the system you plan to use.  
https://pangeo-clivar.vm.fedcloud.eu/jupyterhub/
1. Click the github extension and pull the cloned repository! 
1. Now you are ready to work ;-) 

It would be good to start by copying the https://github.com/pangeo-data/clivar-2022/blob/main/tutorial/pangeo101/data_discovery.ipynb into your notebooks directory!
